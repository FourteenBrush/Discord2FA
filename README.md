### Ever felt the need to enable 2FA on your Server? No? Well,l I will tell you 2 reasons why it makes sense to do so:

#### 1. Security:
With Token-Grabbing becoming a big problem in the Minecraft community
this plugin makes sure to keep your player's accounts safe.
#### 2. Verification:
Implementing a verification process on your server offers many advantages,
such as minimizing the presence of alt-accounts.
